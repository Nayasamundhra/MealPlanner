- Generates weekly meal plans.
- Displays nutritional information for each meal.
- Option to save and load meal plans.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** 
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance and Polymorphism (if applicable)
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
- **File I/O** (for saving/loading meal plans)
- **Java Collections Framework** (for meal data management)
